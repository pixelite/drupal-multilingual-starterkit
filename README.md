Multilingual Starterkit - Install Profile for Drupal
==============================

Comes with all the standard modules used for Drupal multilingual websites, along with the most common configuration settings. Entity translation is used for node and taxonomy term translation.

During the install process, choose which languages to install, and these will automatically be installed and translations imported from localize.drupal.org.

The install profile sets up article and event content types as examples. It also adds Views for these content types.

Usage
================================

Install Drupal 7 as normal. In the root of your project, run the following:

```bash
cd profiles
git clone git@github.com:pixelite/drupal-multilingual-starterkit.git multilingual_starterkit
```
